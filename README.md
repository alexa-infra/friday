Just another free-time project, created for my personal needs. It's supposed to be a home-organizer, made as a single-page web application. It's powered by Python/Flask and Javascript/React.

Mainly it's a container for smaller applications, such as:

* Bookmarks (quick access to websites, etc)
* Calendar
* Documents
* TODO lists
* Recipes
* etc

Plan
----

* frontend
  - docs
    - pretty css
* backend
  - port old documents
